# hmm-pandas
Regarding the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and its associated algorithms (Forward, Backward, Viterbi), much of the research, materials, and implementations are mathematically convoluted.  This project presents the HMM and its capabilities using Pandas dataframes.  The intention is to simplify the HMM as much as possible, and to create a visually appealing representations of the HMM; while preserving the functionality of existing implementations.  In addition, comments are provided throughout the code, explaining every procedure in-depth.

This project is a work in progress, and only the first part of the Viterbi algorithm has been completed.  Later on, this project will also attempt to translate the algorithms into their vectorized counterparts.
